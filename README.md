# Tic Tac Toe using Next.js, Three.js, and React-Three-Fiber

## Introduction

This project features a 3D Tic Tac Toe game built with Next.js, leveraging Three.js and React-Three-Fiber for rendering. The 3D models utilized in the game were created using [Meshy.ai](https://www.meshy.ai/discover) and converted into TSX format using [gltf.pmnd.rs](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/). For state management, I used Zustand, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience throughout the game.
